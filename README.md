# **Full-Stack Application Containerized with Docker**

This project demonstrates how to containerize a full-stack web application using Docker. The application includes a **React frontend**, **Express backend**, and **MongoDB database**. Using Docker Compose, you can quickly set up and run the app, making it easier to deploy and manage.

## **Project Overview**

This application is built to demonstrate how to use Docker to containerize each component of a full-stack application, creating separate but coordinated containers for the frontend, backend, and database. By using **Docker Compose**, we orchestrate these containers to work together, simplifying the setup process and enabling the app to be deployed as a whole.

### **Components**
- **React Frontend**: The frontend user interface built with React.
- **Express Backend**: The backend server built with Express to handle API requests.
- **MongoDB Database**: A MongoDB container to store user data.

## **Prerequisites**

To run this project, you will need:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your system.
- A [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) account if you plan to push images to the cloud.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fliprlab/devops-task
   cd devops-task
   ```

### 2. **Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and specify the following environment variables. Replace the default values if necessary:

   ```bash
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/sampleApp
   ```

### 3. **Create Docker Images**

Each component has its own `Dockerfile` to create separate images.

#### **Frontend Dockerfile**

1. Navigate to the **frontend** directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Build the frontend image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <your_dockerhub_username>/frontend:latest .
   ```

#### **Backend Dockerfile**

1. Navigate to the **backend** directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   ```

2. Build the backend image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <your_dockerhub_username>/backend:latest .
   ```

### 4. **Start Services with Docker Compose**

Navigate back to the root directory and use Docker Compose to start all services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will:
- Create and run containers for the frontend, backend, and MongoDB services.
- Set up a network for communication between the containers.
- Map ports so you can access each service locally.

---

## **API Endpoints**

The backend Express server exposes the following API endpoints for managing user data:

- **GET /api/users** - Retrieves all users from the database.
- **POST /api/users** - Creates a new user with a JSON payload of `{ name, email }`.

---

## **Automation Script**

An automation shell script is included to:
1. Build and tag Docker images for the frontend and backend.
2. Push these images to Docker Hub.
3. Update the Docker Compose file with the latest image versions.
4. Restart the application using the updated images.

Run the script with:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**Note**: Ensure the script is executable by running `chmod +x deploy.sh` if needed.

---

## **Testing and Access**

After starting the application, you can access each service through the following URLs:

- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend**: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
- **API Endpoint**: [http://localhost:5000/api/users](http://localhost:5000/api/users)

---

## **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

- **Cannot GET /**: If you see this message, it means the backend root route (`/`) is not configured. Add a root route if you need a response at `/`.
- **Database Connection Failure**: Ensure MongoDB is running and the `MONGO_URI` is correctly set.
- **Permission Issues**: Use `chmod +x deploy.sh` to make the script executable if necessary.

For additional issues, consult the Docker and Express documentation.
